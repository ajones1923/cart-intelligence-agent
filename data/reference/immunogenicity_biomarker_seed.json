    "text_summary": "Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) directed against chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) constructs represent a critical resistance mechanism in CAR-T cell therapy. ADA formation occurs when the host immune system recognizes non-self epitopes within the CAR ectodomain, particularly the scFv binding domain derived from murine or non-human sources. ADA detection is performed by bridging ELISA using immobilized recombinant CAR ectodomain or by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for confirmatory kinetic analysis. A tiered testing strategy is recommended: screening assay (high sensitivity, low specificity), confirmatory assay (drug depletion), and titer determination. ADA titers >1:100 in bridging ELISA are clinically significant and correlate with accelerated CAR-T clearance from peripheral blood. In the ELIANA trial, approximately 5% of tisagenlecleucel recipients developed detectable anti-FMC63 ADA, with high-titer responses (>1:1000) associated with loss of B-cell aplasia and disease relapse. ADA-mediated resistance is particularly relevant in the context of re-dosing, where prior immunological memory can mount rapid anamnestic responses against the CAR construct.

Murine-derived scFvs such as FMC63 (used in tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, brexucabtagene autoleucel, and lisocabtagene maraleucel) elicit ADA in approximately 3-5% of patients, driven by non-self framework residues presenting multiple MHC class II-restricted T-cell epitopes. Humanized scFvs, in which murine CDRs are grafted onto human acceptor frameworks (e.g., CAT-19 in obecabtagene autoleucel), reduce ADA incidence to <1% by eliminating the majority of foreign framework epitopes while retaining antigen binding through preserved CDR loops. Fully human scFvs derived from phage display or transgenic mouse libraries (e.g., 21D4, JS014) achieve ADA rates <0.5%, as the entire variable region sequence is encoded by human germline genes. ADA titer magnitude also varies by construct origin: murine scFv ADA median titer 1:500 vs humanized scFv ADA median titer 1:50. This differential immunogenicity directly impacts clinical strategy for re-dosing eligibility and choice of second-line CAR-T constructs. PMID:34407456, PMID:33626295.",

ELISpot assays detecting IFN-gamma or IL-5 secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with overlapping peptide libraries spanning the CAR ectodomain identify immunodominant T-cell epitopes. In preclinical immunogenicity assessment, FMC63 scFv contains 18 predicted MHC class II binding peptides (IC50 <500 nM across HLA-DRB1 supertype panel) compared to 4-6 in humanized variants. Clinical ELISpot testing at day 28 and day 90 post-infusion detects anti-CAR CD4+ T-cell responses that precede and drive humoral ADA responses. Patients with detectable anti-CAR T-cell responses (>50 spot-forming units per 10^6 PBMC) at day 28 have a 4.2-fold increased risk of developing high-titer ADA by month 6. This cellular immunogenicity assessment enables early identification of patients at risk for immune-mediated CAR-T rejection, guiding decisions regarding immunosuppressive prophylaxis or construct switching. ELISpot sensitivity exceeds serum ADA detection by approximately 2-4 weeks, providing an earlier warning signal. PMID:33046569.",

Positive HAMA screening redirects patients toward humanized or fully human scFv-based CAR-T constructs, or toward non-antibody binding scaffolds (DARPins, Centyrins) that lack cross-reactive epitopes.

Serial monitoring by qPCR for CAR transgene copies combined with concurrent ADA titer measurement reveals that patients with ADA titers >1:500 experience a median 2.3 log10 reduction in circulating CAR-T copy number over 4 weeks, compared to 0.4 log10 reduction in ADA-negative patients during the same contraction phase. The mechanism involves ADA-mediated opsonization of CAR-T cells, leading to Fc receptor-dependent phagocytic clearance by macrophages and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. ADA isotype analysis reveals IgG1 predominance (60-70%) with IgG3 contributing complement-fixing activity. Neutralizing ADA (NAb) that directly block the scFv-antigen interaction are detected in approximately 40% of ADA-positive patients and are associated with the most rapid CAR-T clearance kinetics (t1/2 <7 days vs >30 days for ADA-negative). This correlation between ADA titer and persistence loss provides a pharmacokinetic rationale for immunogenicity mitigation strategies including construct humanization and transient immunosuppression during the peri-infusion period.

The in vitro component uses monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with recombinant CAR ectodomain protein, co-cultured with autologous CD4+ T-cells for 7 days, and readout by CFSE proliferation and cytokine secretion. A stimulation index (SI) >2.0 in the DC-T cell assay confirms the in silico prediction. The combined score categorizes constructs as low risk (EpiMatrix <10 and SI <2.0), moderate risk (EpiMatrix 10-20 or SI 2.0-3.0), or high risk (EpiMatrix >20 and SI >3.0). This preclinical scoring system has been retrospectively validated against clinical ADA rates for approved CAR-T products, showing 85% concordance.

Unlike ADA-mediated clearance, anti-CAR CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses can directly lyse CAR-T cells through perforin/granzyme-mediated killing upon recognition of CAR-derived peptides on MHC-I. Detection uses HLA-A*02:01-restricted tetramer staining or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in CD8+ T-cells stimulated with CAR-derived peptide pools. Anti-CAR CD8+ T-cell frequencies >0.1% of circulating CD8+ T-cells at day 28 post-infusion correlate with accelerated CAR-T elimination and shorter remission duration. The anti-CAR CTL response is HLA-restricted and therefore varies by patient HLA genotype, with HLA-A*02:01-positive patients showing higher response rates against murine FMC63-derived epitopes. This cellular immune response can persist as memory and mediate rapid rejection upon CAR-T re-dosing, even when serum ADA is undetectable. Combined monitoring of both humoral (ADA titer) and cellular (anti-CAR CTL frequency) immunogenicity provides a comprehensive assessment of host anti-CAR immune reactivity. PMID:31235964.",
