Standard regimen: fludarabine 30mg/m2 x3d + cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 x3d (Flu/Cy). Mechanism: depletes endogenous lymphocytes that compete for homeostatic cytokines (IL-7, IL-15), creating cytokine sink that drives CAR-T expansion. Without lymphodepletion, CAR-T expansion is 10-100x lower and clinical responses are dramatically reduced. Adequate lymphodepletion (ALC <500/uL by day 0) is a key predictor of CAR-T expansion and response.",
