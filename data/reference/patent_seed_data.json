    "text_chunk": "The invention relates to a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct for the treatment of CD19-expressing malignancies, as embodied in the commercially approved product tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah). The CAR comprises an extracellular antigen-binding domain derived from the murine monoclonal antibody FMC63, which recognizes a membrane-proximal epitope on human CD19 with sub-nanomolar affinity (Kd approximately 0.3 nM). The FMC63-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is arranged in a VL-(G4S)3-VH orientation and is connected via a CD8-alpha hinge and transmembrane domain to an intracellular signaling module comprising the 4-1BB (CD137) costimulatory domain fused to the CD3-zeta chain activation domain. The use of 4-1BB costimulation promotes central memory T-cell differentiation and sustained in vivo persistence compared to CD28-based costimulatory designs. The CAR construct is delivered to autologous patient T cells via a self-inactivating lentiviral vector under the control of an EF-1alpha promoter, achieving stable genomic integration and long-term transgene expression. In pivotal clinical trials (ELIANA, NCT02435849), tisagenlecleucel demonstrated an 82% overall remission rate in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The construct also showed clinical activity in adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the JULIET trial. Manufacturing involves T-cell leukapheresis, activation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, lentiviral transduction, ex vivo expansion for 9-10 days, and cryopreservation. The patent covers compositions, pharmaceutical formulations, and methods of treating B-cell malignancies using the described CAR-T cell product.",

    "text_chunk": "This patent describes a chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD19 for use in adoptive T-cell immunotherapy, forming the basis of axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta). The CAR construct incorporates the FMC63-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) as the antigen recognition domain, fused to a CD28 transmembrane and costimulatory signaling domain followed by the CD3-zeta intracellular activation domain. Unlike 4-1BB-based CARs, the CD28 costimulatory domain promotes rapid T-cell activation, robust cytokine production, and immediate effector function, generating a predominantly effector memory T-cell phenotype. The construct is delivered via a gamma-retroviral vector (MSGV1 backbone) incorporating a murine stem cell virus long terminal repeat promoter. The manufacturing process utilizes anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) activation, retroviral transduction on RetroNectin-coated plates, and rapid expansion over approximately 6-9 days. In the ZUMA-1 pivotal trial (NCT02348216) for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma, axicabtagene ciloleucel achieved a 72% overall response rate with 51% complete responses. The CD28 signaling architecture produces faster expansion kinetics in vivo (peak CAR-T levels at day 7-14 vs day 14-28 for 4-1BB constructs) but is associated with higher rates of cytokine release syndrome (CRS grade 3+ in 13%) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS grade 3+ in 28%).

The CAR construct uses the FMC63 anti-CD19 scFv linked to a 4-1BB costimulatory domain and CD3-zeta signaling domain, delivered via a self-inactivating lentiviral vector. A key innovation is the separate manufacturing and formulation of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cell subsets, which are combined at a defined 1:1 ratio in the final drug product (lisocabtagene maraleucel, Breyanzi). This defined composition approach reduces inter-patient variability in the infused product and enables more predictable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. CD4+ CAR-T cells provide helper function including IL-2 secretion, promoting persistence and memory formation, while CD8+ CAR-T cells mediate direct cytotoxicity. The manufacturing process involves immunomagnetic selection of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets from leukapheresis product, separate activation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-conjugated beads, independent lentiviral transduction and expansion, followed by formulation at the target ratio. In the TRANSCEND NHL 001 trial (NCT02631044), the defined-composition product demonstrated a 73% overall response rate with 53% complete responses in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma, with notably lower rates of severe CRS (2% grade 3+) and neurotoxicity (10% grade 3+) compared to non-composition-defined CD19 CAR-T products.

The CAR architecture comprises an anti-CD19 scFv derived from the FMC63 monoclonal antibody, a CD28 hinge and transmembrane domain, CD28 intracellular costimulatory domain, and CD3-zeta signaling chain, identical in molecular design to axicabtagene ciloleucel. The critical distinction lies in the manufacturing process which incorporates a T-cell enrichment step using immunomagnetic depletion of circulating tumor cells (CD19-positive malignant B cells) from the leukapheresis product prior to T-cell activation and transduction. This enrichment step is essential for MCL patients who frequently exhibit leukemic involvement with high numbers of circulating malignant cells that can interfere with manufacturing by competing for anti-CD3/CD28 activation signals and potentially being transduced with the CAR construct. The enriched T cells undergo anti-CD3 activation, gamma-retroviral transduction, and expansion using the same MSGV1 vector platform as Yescarta. In the ZUMA-2 trial (NCT02601313), brexucabtagene autoleucel achieved a 91% overall response rate with 68% complete responses in relapsed/refractory MCL following BTK inhibitor failure. The treatment addresses a significant unmet need as MCL patients failing ibrutinib or acalabrutinib have median overall survival of less than 6 months.

The CAR construct utilizes the 11D5-3 murine anti-BCMA single-chain variable fragment as the extracellular binding domain, which recognizes an epitope on the cysteine-rich domain of BCMA with nanomolar affinity. BCMA is selectively expressed on mature B lymphocytes and plasma cells, including malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma, while absent from hematopoietic stem cells and most normal tissues, providing a favorable therapeutic window. The intracellular signaling module comprises a 4-1BB costimulatory domain and CD3-zeta activation domain, connected via a CD8-alpha hinge and transmembrane region. Lentiviral vector delivery achieves stable CAR transgene integration. In the KarMMa trial (NCT03361748), idecabtagene vicleucel demonstrated a 73% overall response rate with 33% complete responses in heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients who had received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug, and anti-CD38 antibody.

The biepitope design confers avidity-enhanced binding (effective Kd approximately 2 nM) and resistance to antigen escape mutations that might abrogate binding of a single-epitope binder. VHH1 targets an epitope near the APRIL/BAFF ligand-binding interface, while VHH2 binds the opposite face of the BCMA cysteine-rich domain. The two VHH domains are connected by a flexible (G4S)4 linker enabling simultaneous engagement. The compact VHH format (approximately 13 kDa per domain versus 25 kDa for conventional scFv) reduces immunogenicity and improves CAR surface expression density. The intracellular signaling domain uses 4-1BB costimulation with CD3-zeta activation. This construct forms the basis of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti), which demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in the CARTITUDE-1 trial (NCT03548207) with a 97.9% overall response rate and 82.5% stringent complete response rate in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The biepitope binding strategy maintains anti-tumor activity even when BCMA surface density is low, as seen in patients with low BCMA expression by immunohistochemistry.

The methods address a critical bottleneck in CAR-T commercialization: the production of sufficient quantities of high-titer, high-purity lentiviral vector under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions. The process utilizes a stable producer cell line derived from HEK293T cells that constitutively expresses the lentiviral packaging components (gag-pol, rev) and inducibly expresses the transfer vector and VSV-G envelope glycoprotein upon doxycycline addition. This eliminates the requirement for transient transfection of four plasmids, which is labor-intensive, poorly scalable, and subject to batch-to-batch variability. The stable producer line achieves titers of 1 x 10^7 to 5 x 10^7 transducing units per milliliter in optimized serum-free suspension culture conditions using disposable stirred-tank bioreactors at scales up to 50 liters. Downstream purification involves benzonase nuclease digestion, depth filtration, anion exchange chromatography, and tangential flow filtration, achieving greater than 1000-fold concentration with recovery yields exceeding 40%. The purified vector meets release specifications for residual DNA, endotoxin, sterility, replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) absence, and functional titer. Importantly, vectors produced by this method achieve equivalent transduction efficiency of primary human T cells compared to research-grade vector produced by transient transfection.

    "text_chunk": "This patent application discloses a non-viral gene delivery platform for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell manufacturing based on the piggyBac DNA transposon system, eliminating the requirement for viral vector production. The system employs an engineered hyperactive piggyBac transposase (Super PiggyBac, SPB) that catalyzes the precise integration of a CAR transgene cassette flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) from a donor plasmid into genomic TTAA sites. Electroporation of T cells with transposase mRNA and minicircle DNA donor vector achieves stable integration efficiencies of 30-60% without antibiotic selection, comparable to lentiviral transduction. Integration site analysis by LAM-PCR and next-generation sequencing demonstrates a near-random distribution across the genome with mild preference for transcriptionally active regions, without enrichment at proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor loci, supporting a favorable safety profile. The non-viral approach eliminates costly and time-consuming viral vector manufacturing (typically 4-6 months lead time), reduces per-patient manufacturing cost by approximately 60-70%, and avoids concerns regarding replication-competent virus and insertional oncogenesis associated with retroviral/lentiviral vectors. The minicircle DNA donor is devoid of bacterial backbone sequences (antibiotic resistance genes, origin of replication), reducing potential silencing of the transgene and innate immune activation. Manufacturing using piggyBac achieves vein-to-vein times of less than 3 days using overnight activation and next-day electroporation protocols.

TCR knockout is essential for allogeneic (off-the-shelf) CAR-T cell therapy to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) mediated by donor T-cell recognition of host alloantigens. The TALEN pair comprises engineered repeat-variable di-residue (RVD) arrays targeting a conserved sequence in exon 1 of the TRAC locus, generating a double-strand break that is repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) resulting in frameshift mutations and loss of functional TCR-alpha chain expression. TALEN-mediated TRAC disruption achieves knockout efficiencies of 60-85% in primary human T cells, and TCR-negative cells are enriched to greater than 99% purity by immunomagnetic depletion of residual TCR-positive cells using anti-TCR-alpha/beta antibody-conjugated magnetic beads.

The iCasp9 construct comprises a modified human FK506-binding protein (FKBP12-F36V) fused to a truncated caspase-9 lacking the caspase recruitment domain (CARD). Administration of the synthetic dimerizer drug rimiducid (AP1903, AP20187) induces homodimerization of the FKBP12-F36V domains, bringing the caspase-9 catalytic domains into proximity and triggering activation of the intrinsic apoptosis cascade through downstream effector caspases (caspase-3, caspase-7). A single intravenous dose of rimiducid (0.4 mg/kg) eliminates greater than 90% of iCasp9-expressing T cells within 30 minutes in vivo, as demonstrated in clinical studies of haploidentical stem cell transplantation with iCasp9-modified donor T cells (NCT00710892). The rapid kinetics of elimination distinguishes iCasp9 from antibody-dependent safety switches (e.g., CD20-rituximab) which require hours to days for complement-dependent or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The iCasp9 gene is co-expressed with the therapeutic transgene (e.g., CAR) from a single bicistronic vector using a T2A self-cleaving peptide linker, ensuring that all CAR-expressing cells also express the safety switch. The system is applicable to any adoptive cell therapy and provides a critical safety mechanism for managing cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or on-target off-tumor toxicity.

The full-length human CD20 transgene is co-expressed with the CAR from a bicistronic retroviral or lentiviral vector using an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or 2A self-cleaving peptide. Upon rituximab infusion, CD20-expressing CAR-T cells are eliminated through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and direct apoptosis induction, leveraging the well-characterized pharmacology and safety profile of rituximab which has been administered to millions of patients worldwide. In preclinical studies using humanized mouse models, a single dose of rituximab (10 mg/kg) achieved greater than 95% depletion of CD20-positive CAR-T cells within 24-48 hours. The elimination kinetics are slower than iCasp9-based switches but provide sustained depletion through the approximately 21-day serum half-life of rituximab.

This engineered 136-amino-acid polypeptide is approximately one-tenth the size of full-length CD20, minimizing transgene payload and avoiding potential signaling artifacts from overexpression of the multi-pass transmembrane CD20 protein.

The CD20 epitope retains rituximab binding, enabling safety switch-mediated depletion via rituximab-induced ADCC and CDC. In vitro studies demonstrate that anti-CD34 selection achieves greater than 95% purity of RQR8-positive CAR-T cells from mixed populations. Rituximab treatment at therapeutic concentrations eliminates greater than 90% of RQR8-positive T cells within 4 hours in complement-containing assays.

GPRC5D is a seven-transmembrane domain receptor with limited extracellular domain accessibility, requiring specialized binder formats for efficient CAR targeting. The invention provides anti-GPRC5D scFv fragments isolated from phage display libraries and immunized llama VHH repertoires, with binding affinities in the 1-50 nM range. The CAR constructs incorporate these binders with either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains and CD3-zeta signaling. GPRC5D expression analysis across normal tissue panels confirms restriction to bone marrow plasma cells and hair follicle cells, with minimal expression on other tissues, predicting a favorable toxicity profile. In preclinical xenograft models using the GPRC5D-positive multiple myeloma cell lines (OPM-2, H929), anti-GPRC5D CAR-T cells demonstrated potent antigen-dependent cytotoxicity, IFN-gamma and IL-2 secretion, and tumor regression. Importantly, GPRC5D expression is maintained on myeloma cells that have lost BCMA expression, providing a strategy for patients who relapse after BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapy. Combination or sequential targeting of BCMA and GPRC5D may reduce antigen escape-driven relapse. The patent covers anti-GPRC5D binding domains, CAR constructs, and methods for treating GPRC5D-expressing malignancies.",

    "text_chunk": "This patent application describes a chimeric antigen receptor targeting Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) for the treatment of solid tumors, incorporating an armoring strategy with autocrine IL-7 and paracrine CCL19 secretion to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Claudin 18.2 is a tight junction protein with a cancer-specific expression pattern: while Claudin 18.1 is ubiquitously expressed on gastric epithelium, the splice variant CLDN18.2 shows restricted expression in differentiated gastric mucosa and frequent aberrant expression in gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, esophageal cancer, and ovarian cancer. The anti-CLDN18.2 scFv is derived from the humanized monoclonal antibody IMAB362 (zolbetuximab). The key innovation is the incorporation of constitutive IL-7 and CCL19 secretion cassettes downstream of the CAR transgene in a tricistronic lentiviral vector. IL-7 provides autocrine survival and proliferation signals to infused CAR-T cells within the nutrient-depleted and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, overcoming the limitations of short-lived effector T cells in solid tumors. CCL19 (MIP-3beta) recruits endogenous CCR7-positive naive and central memory T cells and dendritic cells to the tumor site, promoting de novo anti-tumor immune responses and epitope spreading beyond CLDN18.2. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, IL-7/CCL19-armored CAR-T cells demonstrated enhanced intratumoral persistence, improved T-cell infiltration depth, and superior tumor regression compared to conventional CAR-T cells. The patent covers armored CAR constructs, cytokine/chemokine secretion cassettes, and methods for treating CLDN18.2-positive solid tumors.",

    "text_chunk": "This patent provides a chimeric antigen receptor targeting the disialoganglioside GD2, a glycolipid antigen overexpressed on neuroblastoma, melanoma, and certain sarcomas, utilizing the 14G2a monoclonal antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment as the antigen recognition domain. GD2 is among the most validated targets in pediatric oncology, with the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody dinutuximab (Unituxin) already FDA-approved for high-risk neuroblastoma. The CAR construct incorporates the 14G2a scFv with optimized codon usage for human T-cell expression, linked to a CD8-alpha hinge and transmembrane domain, 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and CD3-zeta signaling chain. A critical challenge for GD2-targeting CAR-T therapy is potential on-target off-tumor toxicity due to low-level GD2 expression on peripheral nerves and brain tissue, which has been addressed in this invention through affinity-tuned scFv variants with reduced binding affinity (Kd 50-200 nM versus 5 nM for wild-type 14G2a) that maintain cytotoxicity against GD2-high tumor cells while sparing GD2-low normal tissues. In preclinical orthotopic neuroblastoma xenograft models (IMR-32, SH-SY5Y), GD2-targeting CAR-T cells achieved complete tumor eradication and long-term survival. The affinity-tuned variants demonstrated equivalent anti-tumor efficacy with reduced neurotoxicity in GD2-transgenic mouse models.

    "text_chunk": "This patent application describes chimeric antigen receptors targeting glypican-3 (GPC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and several other solid tumors while showing minimal expression in normal adult tissues. GPC3 is an oncofetal antigen expressed during embryonic development but silenced in most adult tissues except placenta, making it an attractive target for CAR-T therapy with a favorable therapeutic window. GPC3 is detected in 70-80% of HCC specimens by immunohistochemistry, with expression correlating with tumor stage and poor prognosis. The anti-GPC3 scFv domains are derived from the humanized monoclonal antibody GC33 (codrituzumab), which targets a C-terminal membrane-proximal epitope of GPC3. The CAR architecture utilizes a flexible IgG4 hinge to accommodate the proximity of the GPC3 epitope to the tumor cell membrane, CD28 transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains comprising either CD28/CD3-zeta or 4-1BB/CD3-zeta. In preclinical studies using HCC xenograft models (HepG2, Hep3B, Huh-7), anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells demonstrated potent and specific cytotoxicity, with complete tumor regression in the HepG2 model at effector-to-target ratios as low as 1:1. The CAR-T cells produced IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and granzyme B upon antigen engagement. Combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade enhanced CAR-T persistence and anti-tumor activity in PD-L1-positive HCC models.

    "text_chunk": "This patent application describes a bispecific tandem chimeric antigen receptor simultaneously targeting CD19 and CD22 on B-cell malignancies to prevent antigen escape, a major mechanism of relapse after single-antigen CAR-T therapy. Clinical data from CD19-targeted CAR-T trials demonstrate that 10-30% of patients relapse with CD19-negative disease, driven by selective pressure from CAR-T cell-mediated elimination of CD19-positive clones. The bispecific CAR comprises two scFv domains arranged in tandem: an anti-CD19 FMC63 scFv and an anti-CD22 m971 scFv connected by a flexible glycine-serine linker, with the entire bispecific binding domain linked to a single intracellular signaling module containing 4-1BB and CD3-zeta. The tandem orientation enables simultaneous engagement of both antigens on the same target cell (cis-binding), generating enhanced avidity and more robust T-cell activation compared to engagement of either antigen alone. Critically, the bispecific CAR maintains cytotoxicity against target cells that have lost one antigen (CD19-negative/CD22-positive or CD19-positive/CD22-negative), providing a safety net against single-antigen escape. In preclinical co-culture assays, the CD19/CD22 tandem CAR demonstrated equivalent cytotoxicity to monospecific controls against double-positive targets and superior activity against antigen-dim populations. In serial rechallenge assays modeling antigen escape, bispecific CAR-T cells maintained tumor control while monospecific CAR-T cells failed. The manufacturing uses lentiviral transduction of autologous T cells. The patent covers bispecific binding domain configurations, tandem CAR architectures, and methods for treating B-ALL and B-NHL.",

    "text_chunk": "This patent application discloses a dual-targeting chimeric antigen receptor strategy simultaneously engaging BCMA and GPRC5D for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Clinical experience with BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapy has revealed antigen escape as a significant mechanism of relapse, with BCMA downregulation or loss detected in 10-30% of relapsing patients. GPRC5D expression is maintained on BCMA-negative relapsed myeloma cells, providing a complementary target. The invention provides multiple embodiments including a bispecific tandem CAR with anti-BCMA VHH and anti-GPRC5D scFv binding domains on a single polypeptide, as well as a bicistronic vector encoding two separate CAR molecules (one targeting BCMA, one targeting GPRC5D) co-expressed in the same T cell. The tandem CAR design enables OR-gate logic where engagement of either antigen triggers T-cell activation, whereas the dual-CAR bicistronic design provides independent signaling through each receptor. Preclinical studies in mixed antigen myeloma models demonstrate that dual-targeting constructs achieve superior tumor clearance compared to either monospecific CAR alone, particularly in settings where tumor cells exhibit heterogeneous antigen expression. The dual targeting approach showed maintained cytotoxic activity against BCMA-negative/GPRC5D-positive, BCMA-positive/GPRC5D-negative, and double-positive myeloma cell lines. In vivo studies in NSG mice bearing mixed BCMA+/BCMA- myeloma xenografts demonstrated complete tumor eradication only with dual-targeting constructs.

    "title": "Logic-gated dual-antigen chimeric antigen receptor system requiring co-recognition of two tumor antigens for T-cell activation",
    "text_chunk": "This patent describes a synthetic biology approach to chimeric antigen receptor design implementing Boolean logic-gated antigen recognition, requiring simultaneous engagement of two distinct tumor-associated antigens for full T-cell activation. The system addresses a fundamental limitation of conventional single-input CARs: the inability to discriminate between tumor cells and normal cells that share the target antigen (on-target off-tumor toxicity). The AND-gate CAR system splits the T-cell activation signals across two separate receptors: a first-generation CAR providing CD3-zeta signaling upon recognition of antigen A, and a chimeric costimulatory receptor (CCR) providing 4-1BB costimulation upon recognition of antigen B. Full T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector function require engagement of both receptors, whereas engagement of either receptor alone is insufficient. This creates a coincidence detector that only activates CAR-T cells at the tumor site where both antigens are co-expressed, while sparing normal tissues expressing only one antigen. The patent demonstrates the concept using mesothelin as antigen A and folate receptor alpha as antigen B, both overexpressed on ovarian cancer and mesothelioma but rarely co-expressed on normal tissues. In vitro co-culture assays confirm that AND-gate CAR-T cells exhibit cytotoxicity and cytokine production only against double-positive target cells, with no activity against single-positive or double-negative cells. In vivo studies demonstrate selective tumor regression without off-tumor toxicity. The patent claims the split-signaling receptor architecture, logic-gated activation methods, and combinatorial antigen recognition systems applicable to any pair of tumor antigens.",

    "text_chunk": "This patent covers an allogeneic (universal, off-the-shelf) chimeric antigen receptor T-cell product targeting CD19 in which donor-derived T cells are engineered with triple genetic modifications: (1) expression of an anti-CD19 CAR, (2) TALEN-mediated knockout of the TCR alpha constant (TRAC) gene to prevent graft-versus-host disease, and (3) TALEN-mediated knockout of CD52 to confer resistance to alemtuzumab lymphodepleting conditioning. The allogeneic approach addresses critical limitations of autologous CAR-T manufacturing including 2-4 week manufacturing time, high per-patient cost ($350,000-$500,000), manufacturing failure rates of 1-5%, and variability in starting material quality, particularly in heavily pretreated patients with lymphopenic T cells. Universal CAR-T cells are manufactured from healthy donor leukapheresis in large batches sufficient for hundreds of patients, cryopreserved, and available for immediate off-the-shelf administration. TRAC knockout eliminates alloreactive TCR-mediated GvHD risk, confirmed by absence of xenogeneic GvHD in NSG mouse models. CD52 knockout enables selective host lymphodepletion with alemtuzumab while preserving the infused allogeneic CAR-T cells. The anti-CD19 CAR uses an scFv targeting CD19 with 4-1BB costimulation and CD3-zeta signaling.

    "text_chunk": "This patent application discloses methods for generating allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cells using CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes for multiplex gene editing, enabling off-the-shelf CAR-T cell therapy. The CRISPR-based approach offers advantages over TALEN and ZFN nuclease platforms including simpler guide RNA design, higher multiplexing capacity, and reduced off-target activity with high-fidelity Cas9 variants (eSpCas9, HiFi Cas9). The method involves electroporation of pre-formed Cas9 protein-sgRNA RNP complexes into activated donor T cells, simultaneously targeting TRAC (to eliminate GvHD-causing TCR), B2M (to eliminate HLA class I expression and reduce host-versus-graft rejection), and PD-1 (PDCD1, to enhance anti-tumor function by removing T-cell exhaustion checkpoint). Triple-knockout efficiencies of 50-70% are achieved by simultaneous delivery of three RNP complexes, with subsequent immunomagnetic depletion of residual TCR-positive cells. B2M knockout eliminates surface HLA-A/B/C expression, preventing recognition and rejection by host CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, substantially extending the persistence window of allogeneic CAR-T cells. PD-1 knockout prevents tumor-mediated T-cell exhaustion through the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. GUIDE-seq analysis and targeted amplicon sequencing confirm minimal off-target editing at computationally predicted sites. The CRISPR-edited allogeneic CAR-T cells demonstrate enhanced anti-tumor function in PD-L1-positive tumor models compared to non-edited controls. Manufacturing from a single healthy donor enables production of 100-500 patient doses, dramatically reducing cost per dose.

Unlike donor-derived allogeneic approaches, iPSC-derived CAR-T cells offer a theoretically unlimited cell source from a single master cell bank, enabling unprecedented manufacturing scale and consistency. The method involves: (1) reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells to iPSCs using a non-integrating Sendai virus vector expressing Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC); (2) CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of TRAC and B2M genes at the iPSC stage to generate a universal hypoimmunogenic cell line; (3) knock-in of the CAR transgene into the TRAC locus using homology-directed repair, placing CAR expression under endogenous TCR promoter control; (4) directed differentiation of engineered iPSCs through mesoderm, hemogenic endothelium, hematopoietic progenitor, and T-cell lineage stages using a defined, feeder-free, serum-free protocol over approximately 40-50 days; and (5) activation and expansion of iPSC-derived CAR-T cells with antigen-presenting cells or artificial stimulation. The resulting iPSC-derived CAR-T cells express the CAR transgene, lack TCR surface expression (preventing GvHD), lack HLA class I (evading host CD8 rejection), and display a naive-like T-cell phenotype (CD45RA+/CCR7+) associated with superior in vivo persistence.

Conventional CAR-T cells have demonstrated limited activity against solid tumors due to multiple barriers including physical exclusion by tumor stroma, metabolic competition, immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-beta, IL-10), regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and T-cell exhaustion. IL-12 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that: (1) enhances CAR-T cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production in an autocrine manner; (2) repolarizes immunosuppressive M2 tumor-associated macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype; (3) promotes dendritic cell maturation and antigen cross-presentation; (4) inhibits regulatory T-cell function within the tumor microenvironment; and (5) stimulates endogenous NK cell anti-tumor activity. The armored CAR construct encodes a single-chain IL-12p70 fusion (IL-12p40-linker-IL-12p35) downstream of the CAR transgene in a tricistronic lentiviral vector. To mitigate systemic IL-12 toxicity, the invention includes an NFAT-responsive promoter driving IL-12 expression that is activated only upon CAR engagement with tumor antigen, restricting IL-12 secretion to the tumor site. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer (ID8), melanoma (B16), and mesothelioma (AE17), IL-12-armored CAR-T cells achieved superior tumor control and survival compared to non-armored counterparts.

TGF-beta is one of the most potent immunosuppressive cytokines in the solid tumor microenvironment, secreted at high concentrations (10-50 ng/mL) by tumor cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and regulatory T cells. TGF-beta signaling through the endogenous TGF-beta receptor on T cells induces cell cycle arrest, suppression of effector cytokine production (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, perforin, granzyme B), upregulation of exhaustion markers (PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3), and differentiation toward regulatory T-cell phenotype, collectively rendering conventional CAR-T cells dysfunctional in TGF-beta-rich tumors. The dominant negative TGFbRII (dnTGFbRII) is a truncated form of the TGF-beta receptor type II lacking the intracellular kinase domain but retaining the extracellular ligand-binding domain. Overexpression of dnTGFbRII competitively sequesters TGF-beta ligand and forms non-functional heteromeric complexes with endogenous TGFbRI, effectively blocking TGF-beta signal transduction.
