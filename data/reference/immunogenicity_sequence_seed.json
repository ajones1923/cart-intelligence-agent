The parental FMC63 scFv contains 18 predicted MHC class II binding peptides (IC50 <500 nM across HLA-DRB1*01:01, *03:01, *04:01, *07:01, *08:01, *11:01, *13:01, *15:01 supertypes) identified by EpiMatrix analysis. CDR grafting onto human VH3-23 and VK1-39 germline acceptor frameworks eliminated 14 of these epitopes by replacing murine framework residues with human germline sequence. Selective back-mutations at Vernier zone positions H2, H27, H29, H30, H47, H67, H71, H93 and L2, L36, L46, L49 were required to maintain CDR loop canonical conformations and VH/VL packing geometry. The resulting deimmunized construct retained 2.5 nM binding affinity (compared to 0.3 nM for parental FMC63), with the modest affinity reduction attributable to altered framework-CDR interactions at the VH-VL interface. In vitro DC-T cell co-culture assays confirmed a 75% reduction in T-cell proliferative response (stimulation index 1.3 vs 5.2 for murine FMC63). This deimmunized variant is comparable to the CAT-19 humanization approach used in obecabtagene autoleucel (AUTO1) and represents the standard strategy for reducing immunogenicity of murine-derived CAR binders.",

JS014 binds a partially overlapping epitope with FMC63 on CD19 (competition ELISA shows 60% cross-blocking), ensuring activity against the same target but with distinct epitope contacts. EpiMatrix immunogenicity scoring yields a Tregitope-adjusted score of 3.2, well below the threshold of 10 for low immunogenicity risk. In DC-T cell co-culture assays using a panel of 20 HLA-diverse donors, the stimulation index was <1.5 for all donors tested, confirming minimal immunogenicity. Clinical ADA rates in early-phase trials with fully human CD19 scFv CARs have been <0.5%, compared to 3-5% for murine FMC63-based products. The moderate binding affinity (4.2 nM) positions this clone within the optimal therapeutic window for CAR-T function, avoiding the tonic signaling and exhaustion associated with ultra-high-affinity binders.
