## 1. Overview

The CAR-T Intelligence Agent is a multi-collection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system purpose-built for CAR-T cell therapy research and development. It breaks down data silos across the entire CAR-T development lifecycle -- from target identification and molecular design through clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory approval, and post-market pharmacovigilance -- and provides unified, cross-functional intelligence grounded in evidence.

### What It Does

A researcher asks a natural-language question such as *"Why do CD19 CAR-T patients relapse with antigen-negative disease?"* The system:

1. Expands the query across 12 domain-specific terminology maps (169 keyword entries)
2. Embeds the question using BGE-small-en-v1.5 (384 dimensions)
3. Searches 11 Milvus vector collections simultaneously using parallel ThreadPoolExecutor
4. Applies collection-specific score weights to rank cross-domain evidence
5. Augments with structured knowledge from a 6-dictionary knowledge graph
6. Synthesizes a grounded response via Claude Sonnet 4.6 with clickable citations
7. Returns the answer with a scored evidence panel and export options (Markdown, JSON, PDF)

### Position in the HCLS AI Factory

The CAR-T Intelligence Agent extends the three-stage HCLS AI Factory pipeline (Genomics, RAG/Chat, Drug Discovery) with a domain-specialized fourth capability. It reads from the existing `genomic_evidence` collection populated by Stage 2 (rag-chat-pipeline) and adds 10 new CAR-T-specific collections.

```
HCLS AI Factory Pipeline
========================

Stage 1: Genomics       FASTQ -> VCF (Parabricks)
Stage 2: RAG/Chat       VCF -> Targets (Milvus + Claude)

         +-- CAR-T Intelligence Agent --+
         |  11 collections (10 new + 1  |
         |  shared genomic_evidence)    |
         |  Knowledge graph + expansion |
         |  Autonomous agent reasoning  |
         +------------------------------+
```

## 3. Component Deep Dives

### 3a. RAG Engine

**File:** `src/rag_engine.py` (687 lines)
**Class:** `CARTRAGEngine`

The RAG engine is the central orchestrator. It wires together the collection manager, embedder, LLM client, knowledge graph, and query expander into a unified retrieval-and-generation pipeline.

#### Constructor

```python
class CARTRAGEngine:
    def __init__(self, collection_manager, embedder, llm_client,
                 knowledge=None, query_expander=None):
        self.collections = collection_manager
        self.embedder = embedder
        self.llm = llm_client
        self.knowledge = knowledge
        self.expander = query_expander
```

All dependencies are injected, making the engine fully testable with mocks.

#### COLLECTION_CONFIG

Defines the weight, label, target-antigen capability, and year-field availability for each of the 11 collections. Weights are read from `CARTSettings` at import time:

```python
COLLECTION_CONFIG = {
    "cart_literature":    {"weight": 0.20, "label": "Literature",    "has_target_antigen": True,  "year_field": "year"},
    "cart_trials":        {"weight": 0.16, "label": "Trial",         "has_target_antigen": True,  "year_field": "start_year"},
    "cart_constructs":    {"weight": 0.10, "label": "Construct",     "has_target_antigen": True,  "year_field": None},
    "cart_assays":        {"weight": 0.09, "label": "Assay",         "has_target_antigen": True,  "year_field": None},
    "cart_safety":        {"weight": 0.08, "label": "Safety",        "has_target_antigen": False, "year_field": "year"},
    "cart_biomarkers":    {"weight": 0.08, "label": "Biomarker",     "has_target_antigen": True,  "year_field": None},
    "cart_manufacturing": {"weight": 0.07, "label": "Manufacturing", "has_target_antigen": False, "year_field": None},
    "cart_realworld":     {"weight": 0.07, "label": "RealWorld",     "has_target_antigen": False, "year_field": None},
    "cart_regulatory":    {"weight": 0.06, "label": "Regulatory",    "has_target_antigen": False, "year_field": None},
    "cart_sequences":     {"weight": 0.06, "label": "Sequence",      "has_target_antigen": True,  "year_field": None},
    "genomic_evidence":   {"weight": 0.04, "label": "Genomic",       "has_target_antigen": False, "year_field": None},
}
```

Weights sum to approximately 1.01. Literature and trials receive the heaviest weighting because they contain the densest evidence text.

#### Core Methods

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `retrieve()` | Full evidence retrieval pipeline (embed, search, expand, merge, augment) | `CrossCollectionResult` |
| `query()` | retrieve() + LLM synthesis (blocking) | `str` (answer text) |
| `query_stream()` | retrieve() + streaming LLM (yields evidence event, then token chunks, then done event) | `Generator[Dict]` |
| `find_related()` | Cross-collection entity linking ("show me everything about Yescarta") | `Dict[str, List[SearchHit]]` |
| `retrieve_comparative()` | Two-entity comparison with separate evidence sets | `ComparativeResult` |

#### CART_SYSTEM_PROMPT

A 64-line system prompt that establishes the agent's 12 domains of expertise, citation formatting rules (clickable PubMed/ClinicalTrials.gov links), cross-functional reasoning guidelines, and the directive to acknowledge uncertainty.

#### Score Weighting Formula

```
weighted_score = raw_cosine_score * (1 + collection_weight)
```

For a literature hit with raw score 0.85: `0.85 * (1 + 0.20) = 1.02`. For a genomic hit with raw score 0.85: `0.85 * (1 + 0.04) = 0.884`. This ensures higher-weighted collections float to the top when scores are comparable.

#### Query Expansion Strategy

The engine handles expanded terms differently based on whether they are known target antigens:

- **Antigen terms** (e.g., "CD19"): Used as Milvus field filters (`target_antigen == "CD19"`) on collections that have the `target_antigen` field. Scores are discounted by 0.8x.
- **Non-antigen terms** (e.g., "cytokine release syndrome"): Re-embedded as new query vectors and searched semantically across all collections. Scores are discounted by 0.7x.

The discount factors prevent expansion hits from dominating the primary search results.

#### Comparative Analysis

When the engine detects comparison patterns ("compare", "vs", "versus") in a question, it:

1. Parses two entities from the question text using regex
2. Resolves each entity through the knowledge graph's `ENTITY_ALIASES` dictionary
3. Runs two separate `retrieve()` calls, one per entity
4. Builds a structured comparison context from the knowledge graph
5. Generates a response requiring: comparison table, advantages/limitations lists, and clinical context

---

### 3b. Collection Manager

**File:** `src/collections.py`
**Class:** `CARTCollectionManager`

Manages 11 Milvus collections (10 owned by this agent + 1 read-only `genomic_evidence` from rag-chat-pipeline).

#### Schema Summary

All collections share:
- **384-dim FLOAT_VECTOR** `embedding` field (BGE-small-en-v1.5)
- **IVF_FLAT** index with `nlist=1024`
- **COSINE** similarity metric
- **Search params:** `nprobe=16`

| Collection | Primary Key | Key Fields | VARCHAR Limits |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| `cart_literature` | id (PMID/patent) | title, text_chunk, source_type, year, cart_stage, target_antigen, disease, keywords, journal | text_chunk: 3000, title: 500, keywords: 1000 |
| `cart_trials` | id (NCT number) | title, text_summary, phase, status, sponsor, target_antigen, car_generation, costimulatory, disease, enrollment, start_year, outcome_summary | text_summary: 3000, outcome_summary: 2000 |
| `cart_constructs` | id | name, text_summary, target_antigen, scfv_origin, costimulatory_domain, signaling_domain, generation, hinge_tm, vector_type, fda_status, known_toxicities | text_summary: 2000, known_toxicities: 500 |

| `cart_manufacturing` | id | text_summary, process_step, vector_type, parameter, parameter_value, target_spec, met_spec, batch_id, notes | text_summary: 2000, notes: 1000 |
| `cart_safety` | id | text_summary, product, event_type, severity_grade, onset_timing, incidence_rate, management_protocol, outcome, reporting_source, year | text_summary: 3000, management_protocol: 500 |
| `cart_biomarkers` | id | text_summary, biomarker_name, biomarker_type, assay_method, clinical_cutoff, predictive_value, associated_outcome, target_antigen, disease, evidence_level | text_summary: 3000, predictive_value: 200 |
| `cart_regulatory` | id | text_summary, product, regulatory_event, date, agency, indication, decision, conditions, pivotal_trial | text_summary: 3000, conditions: 500 |
| `cart_sequences` | id | text_summary, construct_name, target_antigen, scfv_clone, binding_affinity_kd, heavy_chain_vregion, light_chain_vregion, framework, species_origin, immunogenicity_risk, structural_notes | heavy/light_chain: 500, structural_notes: 1000 |
| `cart_realworld` | id | text_summary, study_type, data_source, product, indication, population_size (INT64), median_followup_months (FLOAT), primary_endpoint, outcome_value, setting, special_population | text_summary: 3000, special_population: 200 |
| `genomic_evidence` | id | chrom, pos, ref, alt, qual, gene, consequence, impact, genotype, text_summary, clinical_significance, rsid, disease_associations, am_pathogenicity, am_class | **Read-only** -- created by rag-chat-pipeline |

#### Parallel Search Architecture

```python
def search_all(self, query_embedding, top_k_per_collection=5,
               filter_exprs=None, score_threshold=0.0):
    collections = list(COLLECTION_SCHEMAS.keys())

    def _search_one(name):
        expr = (filter_exprs or {}).get(name)
        return name, self.search(name, query_embedding, top_k, expr, score_threshold)

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(collections)) as executor:
        futures = {executor.submit(_search_one, name): name for name in collections}
        for future in as_completed(futures):
            name, hits = future.result()
            all_results[name] = hits

    return all_results
```

With 11 collections, this spawns 11 concurrent threads. Each thread independently loads its collection into memory, executes the ANN search, and returns results. The `as_completed` pattern collects results as they arrive, without waiting for the slowest collection.

#### Registry Pattern

Two dictionaries provide the single source of truth for collection metadata:

```python
COLLECTION_SCHEMAS: Dict[str, CollectionSchema]  # Schema definitions for creation
COLLECTION_MODELS: Dict[str, type]               # Pydantic models for validation
```

`genomic_evidence` has `None` in `COLLECTION_MODELS` because it is read-only -- this agent never inserts into it.

---

### 3c. Knowledge Graph

**File:** `src/knowledge.py`
**Size:** 6 dictionaries, ~1,500 lines

The knowledge graph provides structured, curated domain knowledge that supplements the vector search results. Unlike the Milvus collections which contain embedded free-text, the knowledge graph contains organized factual data.

#### Six Dictionaries

| Dictionary | Entries | Content |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `CART_TARGETS` | ~25 | Target antigens with protein name, UniProt ID, expression profile, diseases, approved products, key trials, resistance mechanisms, toxicity profile, normal tissue expression |
| `CART_TOXICITIES` | 8 | Toxicity profiles with mechanism, ASTCT grading, incidence, timing, management protocols, biomarkers, risk factors |
| `CART_MANUFACTURING` | 10 | Manufacturing processes with parameters, specifications, failure modes, release criteria |
| `CART_BIOMARKERS` | 15 | Biomarkers with type (predictive/prognostic/PD/monitoring/resistance), assay method, clinical cutoff, predictive value, evidence level, PMID references |
| `CART_REGULATORY` | 6 | FDA-approved products with approval dates, indications, pivotal trials, designations (BTD/RMAT), REMS, EMA approval, subsequent expansions |
| `CART_IMMUNOGENICITY` | 6 | HLA-restricted epitopes, humanization strategies, ADA clinical impact, allogeneic HLA considerations, immunogenicity testing paradigms |

#### Context Retrieval

The public API surfaces five retrieval functions that scan query text for entity mentions:

```python
get_target_context(antigen)        # "CD19" -> formatted target knowledge
get_toxicity_context(toxicity)     # "CRS"  -> grading, management, biomarkers
get_manufacturing_context(process) # "lentiviral_transduction" -> parameters
get_biomarker_context(biomarker)   # "ferritin" -> cutoffs, predictive value
get_regulatory_context(product)    # "Kymriah" -> approval history
get_immunogenicity_context(topic)  # "humanization" -> strategies, tools
```

The master function `get_all_context_for_query()` scans the query against all six dictionaries using keyword matching, returning combined context.

#### Entity Resolution for Comparisons

The `ENTITY_ALIASES` dictionary (67 entries) maps product names, generic names, costimulatory domains, vector types, biomarker names, and immunogenicity terms to canonical entities. This powers the comparative analysis pipeline:

```python
ENTITY_ALIASES = {
    "KYMRIAH":          {"type": "product", "canonical": "Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel)", "target": "CD19"},
    "TISAGENLECLEUCEL": {"type": "product", "canonical": "Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel)", "target": "CD19"},
    "4-1BB":            {"type": "costimulatory", "canonical": "4-1BB (CD137)"},
    "FERRITIN":         {"type": "biomarker", "canonical": "ferritin"},
    ...
}
```

`resolve_comparison_entity()` tries five resolution strategies in priority order: target antigens (exact), product aliases, toxicities, manufacturing processes, and biomarkers.

---

### 3d. Query Expansion

**File:** `src/query_expansion.py`
**Size:** 12 maps, 169 keyword entries, 1,258 lines

Query expansion improves recall by broadening search terms. When a user asks about "CRS," the system also searches for "cytokine release syndrome," "tocilizumab," "IL-6," "ferritin," "Lee grading," and 25+ related terms.

#### Twelve Expansion Maps

| Map | Keywords | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `TARGET_ANTIGEN_EXPANSION` | 28 | Antigen -> diseases, products, clones |
| `DISEASE_EXPANSION` | 17 | Disease -> antigens, products, subtypes |
| `TOXICITY_EXPANSION` | 16 | Toxicity -> mechanisms, treatments, biomarkers |
| `MANUFACTURING_EXPANSION` | 16 | CMC -> platforms, parameters, reagents |
| `MECHANISM_EXPANSION` | 18 | Biology -> pathways, markers, interventions |
| `CONSTRUCT_EXPANSION` | 20 | Engineering -> domains, switches, generations |
| `SAFETY_EXPANSION` | 8 | Pharmacovigilance -> FAERS, REMS, signals |
| `BIOMARKER_EXPANSION` | 13 | Markers -> assays, cutoffs, outcomes |
| `REGULATORY_EXPANSION` | 8 | Regulatory -> designations, pathways |
| `SEQUENCE_EXPANSION` | 8 | Molecular -> scFv, CDR, affinity, nanobody |
| `REALWORLD_EXPANSION` | 10 | RWE -> registries, populations, disparities |
| `IMMUNOGENICITY_EXPANSION` | 12 | HLA/ADA -> epitopes, deimmunization, testing |

#### Expansion Algorithm

```python
def expand_query(query: str) -> List[str]:
    query_lower = query.lower()
    matched_terms: Set[str] = set()

    for category, mapping in ALL_EXPANSION_MAPS:
        for keyword, terms in mapping.items():
            if keyword in query_lower:
                matched_terms.update(terms)

    return sorted(matched_terms)
```

The algorithm is intentionally simple: substring matching against lowercased keywords. This trades precision for speed -- expansion runs in microseconds and the downstream vector search handles semantic relevance.

A category-grouped variant `expand_query_by_category()` is also available for cases where different collections should weight different expansion categories.

---

### 3e. Agent

**File:** `src/agent.py` (263 lines)
**Class:** `CARTIntelligenceAgent`

The agent wraps the RAG engine with planning and reasoning capabilities, implementing the **plan -> search -> synthesize -> report** pattern.

#### Agent Pipeline

```
                  CARTIntelligenceAgent.run(question)
                               |
                  Phase 1: search_plan()
                      |-- Identify target antigens
                      |-- Identify relevant CAR-T stages
                      |-- Determine strategy: broad/targeted/comparative
                      |-- Decompose into sub-questions
                               |
                  Phase 2: rag.retrieve(query)
                               |
                  Phase 3: evaluate_evidence()
                      |-- "sufficient"   (>=3 collections, >=10 hits)
                      |-- "partial"      (>=2 collections, >=5 hits)
                      |-- "insufficient" (anything less)
                               |
                  Phase 4: Sub-question expansion (if insufficient)
                      |-- Execute up to 2 sub-queries
                      |-- Merge additional hits into evidence
                               |
                  Phase 5: rag.query() -> LLM synthesis
                               |
                  Phase 6: Build AgentResponse
```

#### SearchPlan Dataclass

```python
@dataclass
class SearchPlan:
    question: str
    identified_topics: List[str]
    target_antigens: List[str]         # e.g., ["CD19", "BCMA"]
    relevant_stages: List[CARTStage]   # e.g., [CLINICAL, TESTING]
    search_strategy: str               # "broad", "targeted", "comparative"
    sub_questions: List[str]           # Decomposed sub-queries
```

#### Strategy Selection Logic

- **Comparative:** Question contains "compare", "vs", or "versus"
- **Targeted:** Specific antigens mentioned AND at most one development stage
- **Broad:** Everything else (multi-stage, exploratory questions)

#### Sub-Question Decomposition

For "why did X fail?" questions, the agent generates:
1. "What are the resistance mechanisms for [antigen] therapy?"
2. "What manufacturing issues lead to CAR-T therapy failure?"
3. "What patient factors predict poor CAR-T response?"

This ensures that even when the primary search returns thin evidence, the agent can find relevant results by reframing the question.

### 3f. Export System

**File:** `src/export.py` (904 lines)
**Version:** 1.2.0

Three export formats, each with full support for both standard and comparative query results.

#### Public Functions

```python
export_markdown(query, response_text, evidence, comp_result, filters_applied) -> str
export_json(query, response_text, evidence, comp_result, filters_applied) -> str
export_pdf(query, response_text, evidence, comp_result, filters_applied) -> bytes
```

#### Markdown Export

Generates a structured report with:
- Header: query, timestamp, active filters
- Response section: the LLM-generated answer
- Evidence sources: collection-specific tables (see below)
- Knowledge graph context: if available
- Search metrics: total results, collections searched, latency
- Footer: version stamp

#### Collection-Specific Evidence Tables

Each collection renders a different set of columns optimized for its data type:

| Collection | Table Columns |
|-----------|---------------|
| Literature | #, ID, Score, Source, Title, Year, Target, Journal |
| Trial | #, NCT ID, Score, Source, Phase, Status, Sponsor, Enrollment |
| Construct | #, ID, Score, Name, Generation, Costimulatory, FDA Status |
| Assay | #, ID, Score, Type, Cell Line, Metric, Value, Outcome |
| Manufacturing | #, ID, Score, Process Step, Parameter, Batch |
| Safety | #, ID, Score, Product, Event, Severity, Onset, Source |
| Biomarker | #, ID, Score, Biomarker, Type, Method, Cutoff, Outcome |
| Regulatory | #, ID, Score, Product, Event, Date, Agency, Decision |
| Sequence | #, ID, Score, Construct, Target, Clone, Kd, Origin |
| RealWorld | #, ID, Score, Study Type, Product, Population, Endpoint, Outcome |
| Genomic | #, ID, Score, Gene, Consequence, Impact, Clinical Significance, AlphaMissense |

#### PDF Export

Uses reportlab Platypus with NVIDIA-themed styling:

- **Color palette:** NVIDIA Green (`#76B900`), Dark BG (`#1a1a1a`), Light Gray (`#666666`)
- **Layout:** Letter size, 0.6-inch margins
- **Features:**
  - Green header row on all tables with white text
  - Alternating row colors (`#f0f0f0`) for readability
  - Clickable PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov links in evidence tables
  - Markdown-to-flowable conversion: handles headings, bold, bullet lists, block quotes, and inline tables from LLM responses
  - NVIDIA green horizontal rules for section separation

#### JSON Export

Uses Pydantic `model_dump()` for proper serialization:

```json
{
  "report_type": "cart_intelligence_query",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "generated_at": "2026-02-20T14:30:25+00:00",
  "query": "...",
  "response": "...",
  "is_comparative": false,
  "filters_applied": {},
  "evidence": { ... },
  "search_metrics": {
    "total_results": 23,
    "collections_searched": 11,
    "search_time_ms": 142.3
  }
}
```

### 3g. Models

**File:** `src/models.py`
**Contents:** 10 collection models, 14 enums, 4 search/agent models

#### Enums (14)

| Enum | Values | Used By |
|------|--------|---------|
| `CARTStage` | target_id, car_design, vector_eng, testing, clinical | Agent planning, literature classification |
| `SourceType` | pubmed, pmc, patent, preprint, manual | Literature records |
| `TrialPhase` | Early Phase 1 through Phase 4, N/A | Clinical trial records |
| `TrialStatus` | Recruiting, Active, Completed, Terminated, Withdrawn, Suspended, Not yet, Unknown | Clinical trial records |
| `CARGeneration` | 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, armored, universal | Construct and trial records |
| `AssayType` | cytotoxicity, cytokine, flow, proliferation, in_vivo, persistence, exhaustion | Assay records |
| `ProcessStep` | transduction, expansion, harvest, formulation, release, cryo | Manufacturing records |
| `FDAStatus` | approved, bla_filed, phase3, phase2, phase1, preclinical, discontinued | Construct records |
| `SafetyEventType` | CRS, ICANS, cytopenia, infection, secondary_malignancy, organ_toxicity, neurologic, cardiac | Safety records |
| `BiomarkerType` | predictive, prognostic, pharmacodynamic, monitoring, resistance | Biomarker records |
| `EvidenceLevel` | validated, emerging, exploratory | Biomarker records |
| `RegulatoryEvent` | BLA, breakthrough_therapy, RMAT, accelerated_approval, full_approval, label_update, REMS, post_marketing_requirement, complete_response | Regulatory records |
| `RWEStudyType` | retrospective, registry, claims, ehr_analysis, meta_analysis | Real-world evidence records |

#### Collection Models (10)

Each model maps to a Milvus collection schema and provides a `to_embedding_text()` method that generates the string input for the BGE-small-en-v1.5 embedding model:

```python
class CARTLiterature(BaseModel):
    id: str                     # PMID or patent number
    title: str                  # max 500 chars
    text_chunk: str             # max 3000 chars -- embedded text
    source_type: SourceType
    year: int                   # 1990-2030
    cart_stage: CARTStage
    target_antigen: str
    disease: str
    keywords: str
    journal: str

    def to_embedding_text(self) -> str:
        parts = [self.title]
        if self.text_chunk: parts.append(self.text_chunk)
        if self.target_antigen: parts.append(f"Target: {self.target_antigen}")
        if self.disease: parts.append(f"Disease: {self.disease}")
        return " ".join(parts)
```

All 10 models follow this pattern: Pydantic fields with validation, plus `to_embedding_text()` for ingest.

#### Search/Agent Models (4)

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `SearchHit` | Single search result: collection, id, score, text, metadata dict |
| `CrossCollectionResult` | Merged multi-collection results with `hits_by_collection()` grouping and `hit_count` property |
| `ComparativeResult` | Two-entity comparison: entity_a/b names, evidence_a/b, comparison_context |
| `AgentQuery` | Input: question, optional target_antigen, optional cart_stage, include_genomic flag |
| `AgentResponse` | Output: question, answer, evidence, knowledge_used list, timestamp |

### 3h. Ingest Pipeline

**Directory:** `src/ingest/`
**Files:** 15 parser modules + `__init__.py`

#### Base Class

```python
class BaseIngestPipeline(ABC):
    def __init__(self, collection_manager, embedder): ...

    @abstractmethod
    def fetch(self, **kwargs) -> Any: ...

    @abstractmethod
    def parse(self, raw_data) -> List[BaseModel]: ...

    def embed_and_store(self, records, collection_name, batch_size=32) -> int: ...
    def run(self, collection_name=None, batch_size=32, **fetch_kwargs) -> int: ...
```

The `embed_and_store()` method handles:
1. Calling `record.to_embedding_text()` on each Pydantic model
2. Batch encoding via the embedder (BGE-small-en-v1.5)
3. Enum-to-string conversion for Milvus compatibility
4. UTF-8 byte-length truncation to prevent VARCHAR overflow
5. Batch insertion via `collection_manager.insert_batch()`
6. Error handling with continue-on-failure per batch

#### Ingest Pipeline Flow

```
    fetch(**kwargs)                 parse(raw_data)              embed_and_store()
         |                              |                              |
         v                              v                              v
  +------+--------+            +--------+---------+           +--------+--------+
  | API call /    |            | XML/JSON -> list |           | to_embedding_   |
  | file read /   |  raw data  | of validated     |  records  | text() on each  |
  | web scrape    |----------->| Pydantic models  |---------->| Embed batch     |
  |               |            |                  |           | Insert to Milvus|
  +--------------+             +------------------+           +-----------------+
```

#### Parser Inventory

| Parser | Source | Collection | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| `literature_parser.py` | PubMed E-utilities API | cart_literature | CAR-T-specific MeSH query, XML parsing via Biopython |
| `clinical_trials_parser.py` | ClinicalTrials.gov v2 API | cart_trials | JSON API with CAR-T condition filter |
| `construct_parser.py` | Local seed JSON | cart_constructs | FDA-approved products + investigational constructs |
| `assay_parser.py` | Local seed JSON | cart_assays | Cytotoxicity, cytokine, in vivo assay results |
| `manufacturing_parser.py` | Local seed JSON | cart_manufacturing | Process parameters and release criteria |
| `safety_parser.py` | Local seed JSON | cart_safety | Pharmacovigilance and toxicity data |
| `biomarker_parser.py` | Local seed JSON | cart_biomarkers | Predictive and PD biomarkers |
| `regulatory_parser.py` | Local seed JSON | cart_regulatory | FDA approval milestones |
| `sequence_parser.py` | Local seed JSON | cart_sequences | scFv sequences and binding affinity data |
| `realworld_parser.py` | Local seed JSON | cart_realworld | Registry and observational outcomes |
| `faers_parser.py` | FDA FAERS API | cart_safety | Live adverse event reports for CAR-T products |
| `dailymed_parser.py` | DailyMed SPL API | cart_safety, cart_regulatory | FDA drug label sections (boxed warnings, dosing) |
| `uniprot_parser.py` | UniProt REST API | cart_sequences | Protein sequences and annotations for target antigens |
| `cibmtr_parser.py` | CIBMTR public data | cart_realworld | Transplant/cell therapy registry outcomes |

The first 10 parsers work with static seed data (JSON files in `data/reference/`). The last 4 are live data fetchers that pull from external APIs at runtime or on a scheduled basis.

### 3i. Metrics

**File:** `src/metrics.py` (190 lines)

Prometheus metrics with graceful degradation when `prometheus_client` is not installed.

#### Metric Inventory

| Type | Name | Labels | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| Histogram | `cart_query_latency_seconds` | query_type | Processing time distribution (buckets: 0.1s to 30s) |
| Histogram | `cart_evidence_count` | -- | Evidence items per query (buckets: 0 to 30) |
| Counter | `cart_queries_total` | query_type, status | Total queries (rag/agent/comparative/entity_link x success/error) |
| Counter | `cart_collection_hits_total` | collection | Hits per collection across all queries |
| Counter | `cart_llm_tokens_total` | direction | LLM token usage (prompt/completion) |
| Gauge | `cart_active_connections` | -- | Current active connections |
| Gauge | `cart_collection_size` | collection | Records per collection |
| Gauge | `cart_last_ingest_timestamp` | source | Unix timestamp of last ingest (pubmed/clinical_trials) |

#### Graceful Degradation

```python
try:
    from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge, Histogram, generate_latest
    _PROMETHEUS_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    _PROMETHEUS_AVAILABLE = False

    class _NoOpLabeled:
        def labels(self, *args, **kwargs): return self
        def observe(self, *args, **kwargs): pass
        def inc(self, *args, **kwargs): pass
        def set(self, *args, **kwargs): pass

    QUERY_LATENCY = _NoOpLabeled()
    # ... all metrics become no-ops
```

The rest of the application imports metrics helpers unconditionally. If prometheus_client is missing, all calls silently do nothing. This avoids a hard dependency for development and testing environments.

#### Helper Functions

```python
record_query(query_type, latency, hit_count, status)  # One-call update for all query metrics
record_collection_hits(hits_by_collection)              # Per-collection hit counters
update_collection_sizes(stats)                          # Set current record counts
get_metrics_text() -> str                               # Prometheus exposition format
```

---

### 3j. Scheduler

**File:** `src/scheduler.py` (227 lines)
**Class:** `IngestScheduler`

Automated refresh of PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov collections using APScheduler's `BackgroundScheduler`.

#### Architecture

```
  IngestScheduler
       |
       +-- BackgroundScheduler (daemon=True)
            |
            +-- Job: refresh_pubmed
            |     |-- PubMedIngestPipeline.run()
            |     |-- Update LAST_INGEST gauge
            |
            +-- Job: refresh_clinical_trials
                  |-- ClinicalTrialsIngestPipeline.run()
                  |-- Update LAST_INGEST gauge
```

#### Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `INGEST_SCHEDULE_HOURS` | 168 | Refresh interval (168h = weekly) |
| `INGEST_ENABLED` | False | Master switch for scheduler |

#### Graceful Degradation

Like metrics, the scheduler exports a no-op stub class when `apscheduler` is not installed:

```python
try:
    from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
    _APSCHEDULER_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    _APSCHEDULER_AVAILABLE = False
```

#### Public API

```python
scheduler = IngestScheduler(collection_manager, embedder, interval_hours=168)
scheduler.start()        # Non-blocking, runs in daemon thread
scheduler.get_status()   # Returns next_run_time, last_run_time, job_count
scheduler.stop()         # Graceful shutdown
```

## 5. API Layer

**File:** `api/main.py` (556 lines)
**Framework:** FastAPI with Pydantic request/response schemas

### Lifespan Management

The API uses FastAPI's `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan pattern for startup/shutdown:

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup
    _manager = CARTCollectionManager(host, port)
    _manager.connect()
    embedder = _Embedder()              # SentenceTransformer wrapper
    llm_client = _LLMClient()           # Anthropic client wrapper
    _engine = CARTRAGEngine(manager, embedder, llm_client, knowledge, query_expander)
    yield
    # Shutdown
    _manager.disconnect()
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Tag | Description |
|--------|------|-----|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | status | Service health with collection count and total vector count. Returns 503 if engine or Milvus unavailable |
| GET | `/collections` | status | All collection names and record counts |
| POST | `/query` | rag | Full RAG: retrieve evidence + LLM synthesis. Requires both embedder and LLM |
| POST | `/search` | rag | Evidence-only retrieval (no LLM). Fast mode for when only evidence snippets are needed |
| POST | `/find-related` | rag | Cross-collection entity linking. "Show me everything about Yescarta" |
| GET | `/knowledge/stats` | knowledge | Knowledge graph statistics (target counts, toxicity profiles, etc.) |
| GET | `/metrics` | monitoring | Prometheus-compatible metrics exposition |

### Request/Response Schemas

**QueryRequest:**
```python
class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str                          # Required, min_length=1
    target_antigen: Optional[str] = None   # Filter by target (e.g., "CD19")
    collections: Optional[List[str]] = None # Restrict to specific collections
    year_min: Optional[int] = None         # Minimum publication year (1990-2030)
    year_max: Optional[int] = None         # Maximum publication year (1990-2030)
```

**QueryResponse:**
```python
class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answer: str
    evidence: List[EvidenceItem]
    knowledge_context: str = ""
    collections_searched: int = 0
    search_time_ms: float = 0.0
```

### CORS Configuration

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

Currently configured for open access. In production, `allow_origins` should be restricted to the Streamlit UI and known clients.

### API Key Loading

The API loads the Anthropic API key from the rag-chat-pipeline `.env` file if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not already set in the environment. This allows the API to share credentials with the parent platform without duplication.

---

## 6. UI Architecture

**File:** `app/cart_ui.py` (1,119 lines)
**Framework:** Streamlit v1.30+
**Port:** 8521

### Engine Initialization

Uses `@st.cache_resource` to initialize the RAG engine once and share it across all Streamlit reruns:

```python
@st.cache_resource
def init_engine():
    manager = CARTCollectionManager()
    manager.connect()
    embedder = SimpleEmbedder()       # BGE-small-en-v1.5
    llm_client = SimpleLLMClient()    # Anthropic wrapper with streaming
    engine = CARTRAGEngine(manager, embedder, llm_client, knowledge, query_expander)
    return engine, manager
```

### Feature Set

st.session_state.current_evidence   # Latest CrossCollectionResult
st.session_state.current_comp       # Latest ComparativeResult (if any)
st.session_state.engine             # Cached CARTRAGEngine reference
st.session_state.collection_filter  # Selected collections list
```

## 7. Docker and Deployment

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile

```
Stage 1: builder (python:3.10-slim)
    |-- apt-get: build-essential, gcc, g++, libxml2-dev, libxslt1-dev
    |-- Create venv at /opt/venv
    |-- pip install requirements.txt
    |
Stage 2: runtime (python:3.10-slim)
    |-- apt-get: curl, libgomp1, libxml2, libxslt1.1  (minimal runtime libs)
    |-- COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv
    |-- COPY application source
    |-- Create non-root user: cartuser
    |-- EXPOSE 8521, 8522
    |-- HEALTHCHECK against Streamlit /_stcore/health
    |-- Default CMD: streamlit run app/cart_ui.py
```

The builder stage installs compilation dependencies that are not needed at runtime, reducing the final image size.

### Docker Compose Topology

## 8. Testing Architecture

**Directory:** `tests/`
**Files:** 7 test modules + conftest.py
**Total:** 241 tests, 2,336 lines

### Test Files

| File | Focus | Test Count |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `test_models.py` | All 10 collection models, 14 enums, 4 search/agent models, `to_embedding_text()` methods, validation constraints | ~80 |
| `test_rag_engine.py` | CARTRAGEngine: retrieve, query, query_stream, find_related, comparative, prompt building, citation formatting, score weighting | ~40 |

| `test_export.py` | Markdown, JSON, PDF export for standard and comparative results, evidence tables, citation links | ~21 |

### conftest.py Fixtures

The shared fixtures enable all tests to run without Milvus, embeddings, or LLM access:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_embedder():
    """384-dim zero vectors for any embed_text() call."""
    embedder = MagicMock()
    embedder.embed_text.return_value = [0.0] * 384
    return embedder

@pytest.fixture
def mock_llm_client():
    """Always returns 'Mock response' for generate() and generate_stream()."""
    client = MagicMock()
    client.generate.return_value = "Mock response"
    client.generate_stream.return_value = iter(["Mock ", "response"])
    return client

@pytest.fixture
def mock_collection_manager():
    """search() -> [], search_all() -> {name: [] for all 10}, stats -> 42 each."""
    manager = MagicMock()
    manager.search.return_value = []
    manager.search_all.return_value = {name: [] for name in collection_names}
    manager.get_collection_stats.return_value = {name: 42 for name in collection_names}
    return manager

@pytest.fixture
def sample_search_hits():
    """5 SearchHit objects spanning Literature, Trial, Construct, Safety, Manufacturing."""
    return [
        SearchHit(collection="Literature", id="12345678", score=0.92, ...),
        SearchHit(collection="Trial", id="NCT03958656", score=0.87, ...),
        SearchHit(collection="Construct", id="construct-kymriah", score=0.83, ...),
        SearchHit(collection="Safety", id="safety-crs-001", score=0.78, ...),
        SearchHit(collection="Manufacturing", id="mfg-lenti-001", score=0.71, ...),
    ]

@pytest.fixture
def sample_evidence(sample_search_hits):
    """CrossCollectionResult with 5 hits, knowledge context, and search metrics."""
    return CrossCollectionResult(
        query="What is the efficacy of CD19 CAR-T therapy?",
        hits=sample_search_hits,
        knowledge_context="## Target Antigen: CD19\n...",
        total_collections_searched=10,
        search_time_ms=42.5,
    )
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd cart_intelligence_agent
pytest tests/ -v                     # All 241 tests
pytest tests/test_rag_engine.py -v   # RAG engine tests only
pytest tests/ -k "comparative"       # Only comparison-related tests
```

---

## 9. Security Considerations

### Non-Root Docker User

The Dockerfile creates a dedicated `cartuser` and switches to it before exposing ports:

```dockerfile
RUN useradd -r -s /bin/false cartuser \
    && mkdir -p /app/data/cache /app/data/reference \
    && chown -R cartuser:cartuser /app
USER cartuser
```

### API Key Management

- The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is never stored in code or configuration files
- It is loaded from environment variables or the parent pipeline's `.env` file at runtime
- The Pydantic `CARTSettings` class marks it as `Optional[str]` so the application can start without it (in degraded mode, with LLM features disabled)
- Docker Compose passes the key via `${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}` environment variable interpolation

### CORS Configuration

Currently set to `allow_origins=["*"]` for development. Before production deployment, this should be restricted to:
```python
allow_origins=["http://localhost:8521", "https://your-domain.com"]
```

### No Secrets in Code

All sensitive values are externalized:
- API keys via environment variables
- Milvus credentials via Docker Compose environment
- MinIO credentials via Docker Compose environment (default: minioadmin/minioadmin)

### Input Validation

- All API endpoints use Pydantic request schemas with `min_length`, `ge`, `le` constraints
- Collection names are validated against `COLLECTION_SCHEMAS.keys()`
- Year ranges are bounded to 1990-2030
- The `score_threshold` parameter prevents low-quality results from reaching the user

---

## 10. Performance Characteristics

### Parallel Search

The most critical performance optimization is parallel collection search. With 11 collections, sequential search would take 11x longer. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `max_workers=len(collections)` (11) runs all searches concurrently:

```
Sequential:  11 x ~50ms = ~550ms
Parallel:    max(~50ms each) = ~50-80ms  (limited by slowest collection)
```

### Score-Based Filtering

The `SCORE_THRESHOLD` (default 0.4) filters out low-relevance results at the Milvus level, reducing the amount of data transferred and processed:

```python
if score < score_threshold:
    continue
```

### Vector Index Optimization

**IVF_FLAT** with `nlist=1024` and `nprobe=16` provides:
- Good recall (searching 16 of 1024 partitions)
- Fast search time (~milliseconds per collection for <100K records)
- Exact distance computation within probed partitions (no quantization loss)

For collections growing beyond 1M records, consider switching to **IVF_PQ** or **HNSW** for better scalability.

### Embedding Batch Processing

Ingest pipelines batch embed 32 records at a time, leveraging the sentence-transformers library's batched encoding for GPU/CPU efficiency:

```python
embeddings = self.embedder.encode(texts)  # Batch of 32 texts at once
```

### Result Capping

The merge-and-rank step caps results at 30 to prevent excessive prompt lengths:

```python
unique.sort(key=lambda h: h.score, reverse=True)
return unique[:30]
```

This keeps the LLM prompt within a reasonable token budget while retaining the most relevant evidence.

### Streamlit Caching

The `@st.cache_resource` decorator ensures the embedding model, LLM client, and Milvus connection are initialized only once, even across multiple Streamlit reruns. This eliminates the ~5-10 second model loading time on each interaction.

---

## 11. Extension Points

### How to Add a New Collection

1. **Define the Milvus schema** in `src/collections.py`:

```python
NEW_DOMAIN_FIELDS = [
    FieldSchema(name="id", dtype=DataType.VARCHAR, is_primary=True, max_length=100),
    FieldSchema(name="embedding", dtype=DataType.FLOAT_VECTOR, dim=EMBEDDING_DIM),
    FieldSchema(name="text_summary", dtype=DataType.VARCHAR, max_length=3000),
    # ... domain-specific fields
]

NEW_DOMAIN_SCHEMA = CollectionSchema(
    fields=NEW_DOMAIN_FIELDS,
    description="Description of the new collection",
)
```

2. **Register in the two dictionaries**:

```python
COLLECTION_SCHEMAS["cart_new_domain"] = NEW_DOMAIN_SCHEMA
COLLECTION_MODELS["cart_new_domain"] = NewDomainRecord  # or None if read-only
```

3. **Create the Pydantic model** in `src/models.py`:

```python
class NewDomainRecord(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(...)
    text_summary: str = Field(...)
    # ... fields matching the schema

    def to_embedding_text(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.text_summary}"
```

4. **Add to COLLECTION_CONFIG** in `src/rag_engine.py`:

```python
"cart_new_domain": {
    "weight": 0.05,
    "label": "NewDomain",
    "has_target_antigen": False,
    "year_field": None,
},
```

5. **Add a collection weight setting** in `config/settings.py`:

```python
WEIGHT_NEW_DOMAIN: float = 0.05
```

6. **Add collection-specific evidence table columns** in `src/export.py` (both `_format_evidence_table()` for Markdown and `_build_pdf_evidence_table()` for PDF).

7. **Add seed data** in `data/reference/new_domain_seed_data.json` and a corresponding `scripts/seed_new_domain.py`.

8. **Add to docker-compose.yml** `cart-setup` command sequence.

9. **Update tests** in `tests/conftest.py` to include the new collection in `mock_collection_manager`.

### How to Add a New Ingest Source

1. **Create a parser** in `src/ingest/new_source_parser.py`:

```python
from src.ingest.base import BaseIngestPipeline
from src.models import NewDomainRecord

class NewSourceIngestPipeline(BaseIngestPipeline):
    COLLECTION_NAME = "cart_new_domain"

    def fetch(self, **kwargs) -> Any:
        # API call, file read, or web scrape
        response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
        return response.json()

    def parse(self, raw_data: Any) -> List[NewDomainRecord]:
        records = []
        for item in raw_data:
            records.append(NewDomainRecord(
                id=item["id"],
                text_summary=item["description"],
                # ... map fields
            ))
        return records

    def run(self, **kwargs) -> int:
        return super().run(
            collection_name=self.COLLECTION_NAME,
            **kwargs,
        )
```

2. **Optionally add to the scheduler** in `src/scheduler.py` if the source should be refreshed periodically.

### How to Add a New Knowledge Domain

1. **Add a new dictionary** in `src/knowledge.py`:

```python
CART_NEW_DOMAIN: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {
    "entry_key": {
        "field_1": "value",
        "field_2": ["list", "of", "values"],
    },
}
```

2. **Create a context retrieval function**:

```python
def get_new_domain_context(key: str) -> str:
    data = CART_NEW_DOMAIN.get(key)
    if not data:
        return ""
    lines = [f"## New Domain: {key}"]
    lines.append(f"- **Field 1:** {data['field_1']}")
    return "\n".join(lines)
```

3. **Wire into `get_all_context_for_query()`** to add keyword-based scanning.

4. **Wire into `CARTRAGEngine._get_knowledge_context()`** for query-time augmentation.

5. **Add entries to `ENTITY_ALIASES`** if the new domain should participate in comparative analysis.

6. **Update `get_knowledge_stats()`** to include the new dictionary count.

### How to Add a New Query Expansion Map

1. **Define the expansion dictionary** in `src/query_expansion.py`:

```python
NEW_DOMAIN_EXPANSION: Dict[str, List[str]] = {
    "keyword_1": ["term_1", "term_2", "term_3"],
    "keyword_2": ["term_4", "term_5"],
}
```

2. **Register in `ALL_EXPANSION_MAPS`**:

```python
ALL_EXPANSION_MAPS: List[tuple] = [
    # ... existing maps
    ("NewDomain", NEW_DOMAIN_EXPANSION),
]
```

The `expand_query()` function automatically picks up new maps from this list.
