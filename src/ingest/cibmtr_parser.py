"""CIBMTR registry data ingest pipeline for CAR-T Intelligence Agent.

Ingests real-world outcomes data from the Center for International Blood and
Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry. Since CIBMTR does not offer a
public REST API, this pipeline attempts to scrape published summary reports
from the CIBMTR website and falls back to a curated set of key CIBMTR
findings from published analyses.
